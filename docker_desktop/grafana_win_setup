 Step 1: Pull the Grafana Image in Docker Desktop
Open Docker Desktop

Go to the "Images" tab in the left sidebar

In the top search bar (or "Pull Image" button):

Type: grafana/grafana

Click Pull

✅ Step 2: Run the Grafana Container
Now that you have the image downloaded, let’s start the container.

Still in Docker Desktop, go to the Images tab.

Find the grafana/grafana image.

Click the “Run” button next to it.

In the Run a container window:

🛠️ Configure the container:

Setting	Value
Container Name	grafana
Host Port	3000
Container Port	3000
Scroll down to Volumes and:

Click “Add file or directory”

Choose “Volume”

Name it something like grafana-storage

Mount it to: /var/lib/grafana

This ensures all your dashboards/settings are saved even if the container stops.

Click “Run”

Docker will start the Grafana container. ✅

Next up, open your browser and try to visit:
🔗 http://localhost:3000

Let me know once the page loads (or if anything doesn’t work), and we’ll log in!
